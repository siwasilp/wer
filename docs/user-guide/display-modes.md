Click or tap the playback icon button to switch Playback Mode on or off (the icon is in light blue when it is on).

When Playback Mode is on, you can change the date and time and the speed at which time progresses, so you can check the operation of a train on a specific date and time, or enjoy the train operation throughout the entire day as if you were watching model trains in motion. In this state, trains will run according to the timetables and no real-time information will be reflected. For airplanes, only the flights taking off and landing that day will be displayed.

When Playback Mode is off, trains and airplanes are displayed on the map according to the actual operation at the current time. Because it uses real-time information, the location on the map will change accordingly if there is a train delay or flight schedule change.

When Playback Mode is turned on, the “Edit date & time” button and the “+” and “-” buttons to change the playback speed appear just below the time display. If you click or tap the “Edit date & time” button, you will enter the date/time editing mode. The “+” and “-” buttons appear above and below the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second numbers. Use these buttons to change the date and time, and click or tap the "OK" button to confirm the change. Clicking or tapping the "Cancel" button will cancel the change and return to the original setting time. You can also change the playback speed by clicking or tapping the “+” and “-” buttons on the left and right of the number that indicates the speed. It can be set to between 1x (the same speed as real time) and 600x, in increments of 1 from 1x to 10x, 10 from 10x to 100x, and 100 from 100x to 600x.
