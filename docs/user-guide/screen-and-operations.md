<img :src="$withBase('/images/tracking.jpg')" style="width: 400px;">

Clicking or tapping on a train or airplane will turn on Tracking Mode and the screen will automatically move following the movement of the train or airplane. There are eight viewpoints in Tracking Mode: “Position only”, “Back”, “Top-back”, “Front”, “Top-front”, “Helicopter”, “Drone” and “Bird”, allowing you to enjoy the scenery along the railway from your preferred viewpoint. When the Tracking Mode is turned on, map panning, zooming in/out, rotation and tilting operations are disabled (zooming in/out, rotation and tilting are enabled only for the “Position only” viewpoint). Clicking on a map with no trains or airplanes turns Tracking Mode off.

When Tracking Mode is on, the timetable and current position of the train being tracked is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For the train connecting to other lines, the timetables of those lines are also shown. The timetable can be scrolled by using the mouse wheel, dragging the scroll bar, or dragging your finger. Click on the “∨” icon in the upper right corner of the timetable to hide the timetable at the bottom of the screen, or click on the “∧” icon to display it again.

Also, when Tracking Mode is on, some devices will display the [share button](./screen-and-operations.md#sharing-trains-and-flights) to share the train or flight being tracked.

The viewpoint in Tracking Mode can be changed in the Tracking Mode Settings panel. See [here](./configuration.md#tracking-mode-settings) for more details.

Clicking the button will bring up an additional menu, depending on the device you are using, and you can send the tracking URLs for the trains or flight and optional messages through messaging apps, email or social networking apps. When the recipient of the information opens the URL in their browser, Mini Tokyo 3D will be launched, and they will be able to track the same train or flight.

This feature is only available in the following browsers: Edge, Safari, Chrome (Android), Opera (Android) and Samsung Internet

## Delayed Train

<img :src="$withBase('/images/delay-marker.jpg')" style="width: 185px;">

## Displaying Station Exit Information

<img :src="$withBase('/images/station-exits.jpg')" style="width: 490px;">

When you click or tap on a station, the station is selected and the map around the station is enlarged to show the locations and names of the exits on the map. When a station is selected, a list of exits will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If you move the mouse pointer over the name of the exit in the list or tap it, the name of the exit will be highlighted on the map and you can check the location. Clicking on the map where no station exists will deselect it.

In addition to the names, the list of exits also shows the opening hours and icons of stairs or barrier-free facilities. Exits that are closed due to construction or other reasons, or exits that are closed after hours, are indicated in orange. The meaning of the barrier-free facility icons are as follows.
