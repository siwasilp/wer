# Plugins

A variety of plugins are available to display additional information on the 3D map. The information provided by each plugin is displayed as a layer on the map, and can be toggled on and off in the [Layer Display Settings](./configuration.md#layer-display-settings) panel.

## Precipitation Plugin

Based on real-time radar information, precipitation animations are displayed on the map according to the intensity of rain. As you increase the zoom level, the intensity of precipitation is displayed in finer mesh units, and is updated every 10 minutes with the latest information.

For more information, please visit [Mini Tokyo 3D Precipitation Plugin GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nagix/mt3d-plugin-precipitation).

## Fireworks Plugin

This plugin displays fireworks animations on a map. You can watch 3D animation of fireworks launch at a specific location on the map on a scheduled date and time.

## Live Camera Plugin

You can watch trains running on live cameras placed in various locations around Tokyo. Clicking or tapping on a live camera button on the map will zoom in on the location and display the live camera video stream being broadcast from the same viewpoint. The video is transmitted in real-time, but there is a delay of a few tens of seconds, so the actual train tends to appear a little later than the movement of the train on the map. Clicking on a map where there is no live camera button will deselect the live camera.

## PLATEAU Plugin

<img :src="$withBase('/images/plateau.jpg')" style="width: 580px;">

A 3D city model of Tokyo provided by [Project PLATEAU](https://www.mlit.go.jp/plateau/) is displayed in combination with Mini Tokyo 3D. Detailed geometry data and textures of buildings are available for the city center, allowing for the display of very realistic urban landscapes. Due to the relatively heavy load and large memory requirements, use on a high performance device is recommended.

## Tokyo 2020 Olympics Plugin

<img :src="$withBase('/images/olympics.jpg')" style="width: 580px;">

This plugin displays information about the competition schedule and venues for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which was held from July 23 to August 8, 2021. Just below the time display in the upper left corner of the screen, a countdown to the opening ceremony if it is before the event, or an indication of what day it is during the event will be displayed. In addition, pictograms of the competitions will appear on the map at the locations of the competition venues, and when clicked or tapped, it will zoom in to that location and show the details of the competition schedule for that venue. Also, near the Kokuritsu-kyogijo station, an elaborate 3D model of the Olympic Stadium built for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is displayed.
