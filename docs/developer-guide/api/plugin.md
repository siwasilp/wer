# PluginInterface

Interface for custom plugins added to the map. This is a specification for implementers to model: it is not an exported method or class.

Developers can implement callback methods to customize the Mini Tokyo 3D map. In order to add plugins, the objects that implement this interface have to be set to the [`Map`](./map.md) constructor option `plugins`.

Custom plugins must have a unique `id`, and must have the `name` and `iconStyle`. They may implement `onAdd`, `onRemove`, `onEnabled`, `onDisabled` and `onVisibilityChanged`.

The plugin will be visible only in the clock modes specified here. `'realtime'` and `'playback'` are supported. If not specified, it will be always visible.
